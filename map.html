                <p style= "font-size: 1.3vw;">Using GPS data, our application tracks your location and finds out whether you have been 
                    in contact with a COVID-19 patient. It also shows the location of reported cases in your area. 
                    Be aware that this application is by no means an official test for the Corona-virus. You may still 
                    have the virus without coming into contact with others. Please consult a doctor for any concerns.
