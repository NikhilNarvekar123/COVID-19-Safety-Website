      <h2>Site Information</h2>

      <p style= "font-size: 1.3vw; padding-bottom: 0.2vw;">
        This site was made as an early-warning system to inform users if they have been in contact 
        with someone confirmed to have tested positive for Corona-Virus (COVID-19). This is determined 
        by using GPS-location data and checking whether the COVID-positive patient's phone and the user's 
        phone have been near each other in the same location in a given time-frame.  
      </p>

      <p style= "font-size: 1.3vw; padding-bottom: 0.2vw;">
        <strong>DISCLAIMER: THIS SERVICE SHOULD NOT BE USED AS A DIAGNOSTIC TOOL.</strong> 
      </p>
      
      <p style= "font-size: 1.3vw; padding-bottom: 1vw;">
        There are many factors involved in the spread of the disease,
        and due to given inaccuracy of GPS-location data it is possible that you haven't actually come into
        contact with a postive patient. Moreover, while user emails are verified, it is still possible for 
        users to input incorrect information when making their profile (false positives). Our dev team is currently
        working to add extra validation steps. 
      </p>
      
      <p style= "font-size: 1.3vw; padding-bottom: 1vw;">
        The website also offers a list of open restaurants and businesses in your area. It also includes 
        safety tips. With future updates, it will also assign a susceptibility "score" to each user, indicating 
        how likely a user is to get COVID-19 based on their personal health data.
